        Even though the presence of artificial intelligence technology or artificial intelligence (AI) requires science, technology, engineering, and mathematics or STEM-based talents. However, these advances also underscore the importance of the humanities and arts in a way that AI cannot.
        <br>
        <br>
Kompas Daily Data Journalism Team's analysis shows that the business sector with the highest potential for AI utilization is the industrial sector that has workers with relatively high levels of education, especially from STEM majors and those who master digital skills.
For example, based on the micro data survey analysis of the National Labor Force conducted by the Central Bureau of Statistics (Sakernas BPS) in 2021, the information and communication sector, which has the highest exposure to AI, also has a fairly high percentage of STEM workers, accounting for 39 percent of the total workforce in that sector. Similarly, other sectors such as corporate services have 27.6 percent and financial and insurance services have 27.2 percent of their workforce comprised of STEM graduates.
This shows that the sector that is heavily loaded with STEM fields is the sector that can reap the greatest benefits of AI while also experiencing high exposure to AI. Nationally, there are 20 million STEM graduates or 16.6 percent of the total workforce available.
<br><br>
Digital skills mastery can also be an additional asset for developing AI. Data analysis from the National Labor Force Survey (Sakernas) of BPS shows that there are 44 million or 36.9 percent of the total workforce who are proficient in using the internet to support their daily work.
<br>
<br>
The increasing number of workers who can use the internet will support the mastery of AI in potentially exposed sectors. The information and communication sector that is exposed to AI the most, with 93 percent of its workforces mastering the internet. The financial and insurance services are also supported by 90.5 percent of workers who are accustomed to using the internet daily.
Director General of Higher Education at the Ministry of Education, Culture, Research and Technology, Nizam, assesses that the potential brought by AI can be considered astonishing. The launch of the Campus Merdeka program, according to Nizam, is actually anticipating the very rapid technological changes through the Micro Credential Program for Indonesian Students. This program enables students to take industry competency courses in collaboration with industry players.
"We are collaborating with Google, Microsoft, Huawei, Nvidia, Cisco, and almost all global players in the field of technology through the Merdeka Campus program which micro credentials to prepare a talent pool in the field of machine learning, deep learning, and cloud computing. So we are aware that AI will be present and will really need future talents," said Nizam, Thursday (22/6/2023) in Jakarta.
The quantity of graduates in computer and informatics field in Indonesia is actually quite sufficient. In its records, almost 10 percent of higher education graduates in Indonesia every year, or almost 1 million people, are graduates from information technology fields.
<br>
<br>
However, in terms of quality, there is still room for improvement. "So actually, if we say that we lack graduates, it's not really true. What we need to improve is the quality," said Nizam. <br>
<br>
<h2>Humanities</h2>
<br>
The presence of AI underscores the importance of specialized human resources in social and humanities, especially those related to human interaction. Because AI cannot replace this.
<br>
Philosophy writer and lecturer at the Jakarta Art Institute Martin Suryajaya is of the same opinion. It becomes important to incorporate art or humanities components into STEM in order to welcome the landscape of the future world of work. From STEM to STEAM with arts (art) tucked in.
<br>
Education policy expert and also the General Chairperson of the Indonesian Teacher Union, Unifah Rosyidi, acknowledges that Indonesian students may still be lacking in the basic fields of science and mathematics. However, with AI's expertise in these fields, the importance of social sciences and humanities is also increasing.
<br>
"If indeed interested in STEM, students must ensure that they do not lose their empathy. But those interested in social sciences must also understand the basic sciences. Because these basic sciences are skills for human survival," said Unifah.
Therefore, data, AI, and automation expert from IBM technology company Kieran Hagan believes that Indonesia has its own potential in utilizing AI. <br>
<br>
"(Indonesia) has a young workforce that has enormous potential for further education, as well as a customer service culture that can make very good use of AI," said Hagan. <br>
<br>
<h2>Industry needs</h2>
<br>
The industry's need for AI competence is reflected in the emergence of a number of higher education study programs aimed at directly addressing the need for talent in the future. For example, Airlangga University (Unair) will begin offering a Robotics and Artificial Intelligence study program in 2020.
Dean of the Faculty of Advanced and Multidisciplinary Technology at Airlangga University, Dwi Setyawan, stated that this program is highly sought after and plans to increase its learning capacity.<br>
<br>
Head of the Computer Science Program at Bina Nusantara University, Derwin Suhartono, estimated that in the future, along with the digitalization of all aspects of life, almost all study programs will involve the use of computers and artificial intelligence. Therefore, it is important for universities to be able to accommodate multidisciplinary interests.
<br>
<br>
"Two years ago, our team created a minor program in a digital ecosystem. This digital ecosystem combines the subjects of information systems, information technology, and marketing communication into one. All students, except for computer science majors, are eligible to take this minor package," said Derwin.
The Head of the Center of Digital Economy and SMEs Institute for Development of Economics and Finance (INDEF), Eisha M Rachbani, believes that this analysis confirms her view that STEM graduates will benefit from AI.
<br>
This is because he believes that the economic growth accelerated by AI will also be enjoyed by those who not only "control AI" but also those who can truly adopt AI for their work.
Director of Human Resources Research and Development at the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology (Kominfo), Hary Budiarto, said that the ability of Indonesian workers to adapt to new technology is important.
<br>
Hary also highlighted the availability of infrastructure. Currently, the government has built 5,410 base transceiver station or BTS towers in the frontier, remote, and underdeveloped areas (3T).
<br>
"AI implementation would not be possible; ChatGPT cannot be used by everyone if we cannot establish the necessary digital infrastructure and connectivity," said Hary.
